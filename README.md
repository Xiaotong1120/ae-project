Business Question: 
How can analytics-ready operational data help identify bottlenecks in an order fulfillment process?

Data Source: 
This project uses a subset of the LaDe (Last-mile Delivery) public dataset, which contains real-world delivery task events with timestamps.
Only event-level fields (order identifier, process step, and event timestamp) are used to construct analytics-ready operational data for bottleneck analysis.
